# Hands-on AWS Workshop for the EV Charging Platform

![AWS Workshop Architecture Overview](/images/2-Proposal/AWS-architecture.png)

## Overview

This chapter is a hands-on workshop guide for the AWS architecture behind the EV Charging Station Management System. It does not teach local application setup. Instead, it explains how the deployed AWS services receive traffic, run the backend, store data, protect secrets, and support operations.

## How to Use This Workshop

- Follow the sections in order from edge services to observability.
- Replace placeholder values such as `${APP_DOMAIN}` and `${DB_INSTANCE_ID}` with your own environment values.
- The CLI examples use `bash` syntax. If you use PowerShell, adapt quoting accordingly.
- Prefer a non-production account for experiments such as Route 53 changes, CloudFront invalidations, or RDS failover tests.
- Read each section in two passes: first for the flow, then for the commands and verification steps.

## Services Used in This Architecture

- **Edge and frontend delivery**: Amazon Route 53, Amazon CloudFront, AWS WAF, Amazon S3, Amazon Location Service
- **Application runtime**: Amazon VPC, Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, Application Load Balancer, Amazon EC2, EC2 Auto Scaling
- **Data layer**: Amazon RDS in a primary and standby layout
- **Operations and security**: AWS Systems Manager, IAM instance profile, AWS Secrets Manager, AWS KMS
- **Observability and communication**: Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon SES, Route 53 email DNS records

## Services Not Shown in This Diagram

- **API Gateway**: Not used here because public application traffic enters through CloudFront and then the Application Load Balancer.
- **Lambda**: Not shown. The backend is modeled as long-running EC2 instances.
- **ECS / EKS**: Not shown. Container orchestration is outside the scope of this design.
- **DynamoDB**: Not shown. Persistent data is modeled as relational data in Amazon RDS.
- **EventBridge / SQS / SNS**: Not shown. The diagram emphasizes synchronous request flow and direct service integrations.
- **Cognito**: Not shown. The visible admin path uses IAM and AWS Systems Manager rather than a user pool.

## Recommended AWS Access

- Route 53 read and change permissions for DNS validation tasks
- CloudFront and S3 permissions for frontend deployment checks
- EC2, ELBv2, Auto Scaling, and VPC read permissions for application runtime inspection
- RDS read permissions, and controlled reboot permissions only in approved environments
- SSM, Secrets Manager, IAM, KMS, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and SES read permissions for operations work
